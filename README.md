# Currency Converter

## What is a Currency Converter?
A currency converter takes in a base currency and will then show you how it converts to other world currencies. For instance, if you are using U.S. Dollars as your base currency, and are interested in how that may convert to Euros for an upcoming vacation, you would type in the amount of USD that you have and the converter will display the amount of Euros your USD are equal to.


## Goals for the Currency Converter
1. Design a responsive currency conversion application.
2. Top section, user should be able to choose a base currency from one of the seven most used currencies in the world and convert to the remaining six currencies.
3. Bottom section, user should be able to choose base currency and directly convert to any other world currency.
